# LINDOR VAN MALLEBAAR

*Sexual contacts between slaves and their owners were viewed with disfavour by the authorities, and sometimes, as in this case, by other slaves as well.[^1] The 26-year-old Lindor van Mallebaar was reported to his owner by a fellow slave who saw him with the 22-year-old daughter of his owner in highly compromising circumstances. Although Lindor avoided the death penalty by his claim that it was her incitement that led to the incident, he was sentenced to life on Robben Island for his actions.[^2]*

TRANSLATION

There appears before the undersigned deputised *heemraden*, the honourables Dirk Wouter Hofman and Jacob Eksteen, Jephta van Batavia, bondsman of the former chief surgeon of the honourable Company’s hospital at the Cape, the honourable Pieter Domus,[^3] who declares, on the requisition of the landdrost here, the honourable Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, it to be true:

That fourteen days before yesterday, the deponent was ordered by his owner, shortly before the same repaired to bed in the afternoon, to have his fellow slaves Lindor van Mallebaar and Galant van Bougies spit a certain piece of land in the garden. That since, after waiting for half an hour, the aforementioned Lindor had not come to the garden, the deponent went to the kitchen and looked through the window to see whether or not the aforementioned Lindor was in there.

That the deponent saw the aforementioned Lindor, having the innocent daughter of his owner, named Mietjie, sitting backwards on his lap. The deponent called out to him: What are you doing with the *nonje* on your lap? Upon which the aforementioned Lindor instantly stood up, and when the deponent went from the window and entered the kitchen through the door, he found the aforementioned Lindor busy doing up his trousers.

That the deponent thereupon immediately went to the bedroom of his owner and found him in the *galderij*, to whom the deponent, out of scruple and also because he did not wish to hurt his owner’s feelings, only reported to have found Lindor with the aforementioned daughter of his owner, and that when he had called out: “What are you doing with *nonje*?”, the same had stood up, but not that the deponent, upon entering the kitchen door, had seen the aforementioned Lindor doing up his trousers. Likewise, for the same reason as above, the deponent similarly did not inform the petitioner of the latter when he enquired about this incident.

There being nothing more to declare, the deponent asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, declaring it to be the whole truth.

Thus recorded at the secretary’s office in Stellenbosch on 20 July 1793.

This mark X was set down by the deponent with his own hand.

As delegates, \[signed\] D.W. Hoffman, J. Eksteen.

In my presence, \[signed\] J.P. Faure, secretary.

[^2]: The documentation in this case includes the *eijsch*, the testimony of Jephta van Batavia, which was a copy of that transcribed here, the interrogation of Lindor van Mallebaar (who is referred to in the index as Lindor van Bengalen, either a clerical error or an indication of the fluidity of slave toponyms), CJ 447, ff. 491-507 as well as a *sententie*, CJ 796, ff. 267-72. Lindor stated in his interrogation that Mietjie had come and sat on his lap of her own accord and that he had pushed her off but that she persisted. He confessed that he had twice had sexual contact with her, on her intitiative, CJ 447, ff. 504-6, articles 7-15. The case was brought to the Council of Justice on 12 September 1793 when Lindor responded to the charge by saying ‘het is de nonje haar schuld’ (it was the *nonje*’s fault), CJ 75, f. 195. The case was held over for consideration until 7 October, when Lindor was sentenced to be placed under the gallows with a rope around his neck, then to be whipped and branded and to work in chains on Robben Island for life, CJ 75, ff. 194-95 and 209-10. This was a mitigation of the recommendation of the *eijsch* that Lindor should be hanged (CJ 447, f. 496); it appears that Lindor had succeeded in persuading the court that the episode was not entirely his fault.
