# ISAAK DE VILLIERS JANSZ

*This case is one of very few which provide insight into the lives of slave children.[^1] Lakij, a young slave boy, was whipped and put in chains by his owner, Isaak de Villiers Jansz Lakij complained to a neighbouring burgher, who sent him to the landdrost.*

*We do not know if any action was taken against De Villiers.[^2] This brief episode shows the demands made on young slaves, as well as being another indication of the role the authorities could play to check the excesses of slave owners.*

## TRANSLATION

Statement given, on the requisition of the titular merchant and landdrost, the honourable Hendrik Lodewijk Bletterman, and in the presence of the undersigned *heemraden*, the honourables, Christman Joël Ackerman and Pieter Gerhard Wium, by the little slave boy Lakij, about 12 years old, belonging to the burgher Isaak de Villiers Jansz, going as follows:

That some days ago, the testifier, who had to look after the youngest child of his owner, was ordered by his mistress to fetch a basket from somewhere else, and went to do this and left the child alone on the stoep, and when, a moment thereafter, he heard it crying, he ran back and saw that it had fallen off the stoep.

That his mistress, who discovered this, informed his owner of it, who then had him laid down on the ground and held tight by four *jongens*, while his owner beat him on his buttocks with a *sjambok* (as the visible scars thereof, as well as lashes previously received on his back, themselves also proved this to the aforementioned *heemraden*) and afterwards, when his mistress said that the testifier was a rogue and would run away after receiving the beating, he had a chain put on his leg.

That by eventide the testifier left home and went to the burgher Isaak Minnaar to complain over this; that the said Minnaar kept him that night with him and the following day sent him to Stellenbosch.

There being nothing further to relate, the testifier asserts to be convinced of the accuracy of his statement as in the text, declaring it to be the whole truth.

Thus related at the office of the secretary in Stellenbosch on 11 January 1790.

This mark X was set down with his own hand by the testifier.

As delegates, \[signed\] C. Joël Ackerman, P.G. Wium.

With my cognisance, \[signed\] J.P. Faure, secretary.

[^1]: The children of female slaves were also slaves, the property of their mothers’ owners. They could be sold at any age at their owners’ will, although in practice most were kept with their mothers until they were at least of an age to be of greater value. They were defined as children in the *opgaaf* tax returns until the age of 16 for boys and 14 for girls (reflecting the primacy given to child-bearing for women and to labour for men). They worked with the women and other slaves during peak labour periods, and were also, as in this case, used when older as child-minders or for domestic jobs around the house or farm. See Mentzel 1925: 90 and Worden 1985: 88.

[^2]: The case was not sent to the Council of Justice.
