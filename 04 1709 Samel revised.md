# SAMEL

*This brief note in the Stellenbosch notarial records provides a rare example in the judicial records of slaves who refuse to run away because they are well treated by their owners.[^1] A further revealing factor is that several are from Madagascar. It is not stated where Samel,[^2] the slave who wanted to entice them to escape, came from, but the comment that he wanted them to go to ‘their’ country might suggest that he too was from Madagascar and was making an appeal to them on the grounds of their common place of origin.[^3]*

*There is no mention of Samel in the Court of Justice records – he might not have been captured, or else may have been killed before he could be brought to trial.[^4]*

TRANSLATION

There appears before the undersigned delegates from the *Collegie van landdrost en heemraden[^5] * the slaves: Coridon van Batavia, bondsman of the farmer in Drakenstein, Daniel Hugo, about 30 years old; Pieter van Madagascar, bondsman of the farmer Louis Heuris, who is about 22 years old; and Damon van Madagascar, bondsman of the farmer Francois Retieff, about 30 years old, all living in Drakenstein. Which slaves, without even the least coercion, voluntarily confessed how the slave of Pieter Erasmus, named Samel, came to them, the first two deponents, at the mill in Drakenstein, and told and encouraged them to run away. That they, the first two deponents, did not want to do that since they have good *basen* and are not in want of anything. The third deponent says that the aforementioned Samel also came to him at the house of his *baas* Francois Retieff, and likewise encouraged him to go to their country, but that he refused this, saying: “I have a good *baas* and mistress, why would I run away then?” That the aforementioned Samel said: “Then I will look for other *jongens*”. However, they all confess jointly that they have kept this a secret and have kept it hidden from their *basen*, without being able to give reasons why, except for: “We are to blame”.

Thus confessed in the chamber of council in Stellenbosch, in the presence of the honourable *heemraden* Jan Botma and Dirk Coetse who, together with the confessants and me, the secretary, signed the original.

Today, 3 October 1709.

This mark X Coridon has made.

This X Pieter has set.

This X Damon has made.

[^1]: This case is discussed by Biewenga (1999: 110) as an example of loyalty by slaves, a topic which is often overlooked because of the nature of the criminal records. For another case of slaves who refused to run away, see 1726 Scipio van de Cust.

[^2]: This might be a spelling alternative for Samuel which, like other Biblical names, was relatively commonly given to slaves.

[^3]: Malagasy slaves were particularly prone to escape into the interior, believing that they could reach Madagascar by travelling overland, Alpers 2004: 59, Armstrong & Worden 1989: 157. The mutiny by Malagasy slaves aboard the *Meermin* in 1766 provides a good example of how slaves from the island believed they were within reach of home (see Alexander 2004). Such an option was not open to slaves who had been transported across the Indian Ocean from South or Southeast Asia.

[^4]: The *regtsrollen* and documents in criminal cases for 1709 make no mention of a slave named Samel (CJ 5 and CJ 313).
